A simple but powerful Java script that converts the online **Online  Spring Boot Handbook** into a single, high-quality PDF for offline study.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to study the [Coding Shuttle Spring Boot Guide](https://www.codingshuttle.com/spring-boot-handbook/spring-boot-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-for-beginners/) without needing internet access all the time. However, the site doesn't have a "Download PDF" button, and clicking through separate links was frustrating.

Instead of doing it manually, I wrote this script to do the hard work for me. It visits every chapter, removes the sidebar menus, saves it as a PDF, and stitches them all together into one complete book.

## ✨ Features
* **It’s Smart:** It automatically finds all the chapter links on the main page.
* **Clean Output:** It uses JavaScript to hide the sidebar/navigation menus before printing, so pages look clean.
* **One File:** It merges all the individual chapters into a single `Full_Spring_Boot_Handbook.pdf`.
* **No Setup Headaches:** It downloads the correct Chrome driver automatically, so you don't have to configure paths.

## 🛠️ Technology Used
* **Java (JDK 21)** - The core logic.
* **Selenium WebDriver** - To open the browser, inject JavaScript, and "print" the pages.
* **Apache PDFBox** - To merge the PDF files.
* **Maven** - To manage dependencies.

## 📦 How to Run It
If you want to try this on your own machine:

1.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Siddhantkr19/SpringBoot-Doc-Scraper.git](https://github.com/Siddhantkr19/SpringBoot-Doc-Scraper.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA** (or any Java IDE).
3.  **Let Maven load** the libraries (Selenium, PDFBox, etc.).
4.  **Run `Main.java`**.

The script will open a background Chrome window, start processing chapters, and after a few minutes, you'll find `Full_Spring_Boot_Handbook.pdf` in your project folder.
